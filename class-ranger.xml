        <description>
    <p>Rough and wild looking, a human stalks alone through the shadows of trees, hunting the orcs he knows are planning a raid on a nearby farm. Clutching a shortsword in each hand, he becomes a whirlwind of steel, cutting down one enemy after another.</p>
    <p class="indent">After tumbling away from a cone of freezing air, an elf finds her feet and draws back her bow to loose an arrow at the white dragon. Shrugging off the wave of fear that emanates from the dragon like the cold of its breath, she sends one arrow after another to find the gaps between the dragon’s thick scales.</p>
    <p class="indent">Holding his hand high, a half-elf whistles to the hawk that circles high above him, calling the bird back to his side. Whispering instructions in Elvish, he points to the owlbear he’s been tracking and sends the hawk to distract the creature while he readies his bow.</p>
    <p class="indent">Far from the bustle of cities and towns, past the hedges that shelter the most distant farms from the terrors of the wild, amid the dense-packed trees of trackless forests and across wide and empty plains, rangers keep their unending watch.</p>
    <h4>RUGGED SURVIVALISTS</h4>
    <p>Rangers may live on the fringes of civilization, but the wilderness is their true home. Rangers have a deep connection to the land they make their home, and all its flora and fauna. Living off the land is second nature to them: they are well-versed in tracking, hunting and gathering, reading the subtle messages hidden in the terrain. The ranger lives in this world, yet stands apart from it; their knowledge, ingenuity and craftsmanship set them apart from wild beasts. Instead, the ranger lives in balance between nature and civilization, one foot in each world, protecting each from the other's encroachment, and threats from beyond.</p>
    <p class="indent">As master warriors of the wilderness, rangers are rarely satisfied with mundane quarry, and learn specialized techniques to hunt the monsters that threaten their beloved balance: humanoid raiders, rampaging beasts and monstrosities, terrible giants, and deadly dragons. They learn to track their quarry as a predator does, moving stealthily through the wilds and hiding themselves in brush and rubble. Once they have the scent, a ranger will follow their prey to the ends of the earth, and finish them with deadly skill.</p>
    <h4>ROVING ADVENTURERS</h4>
    <p>Many rangers make their living as hunters, guides or trackers in their home territory, but others hear the call of new lands to explore, greater prey to conquer, and helpless people in need of protection and guidance. Taking little with them but what they can carry and perhaps a beast companion, these rangers pursue the calling of the adventurer.</p>
    <p class="indent">Accustomed to life far from the comforts of a dry bed and a hot bath, rangers are well-suited to the adventuring lifestyle, though their fierce independence may put them at odds with fellow travelers. Faced with city-bred adventurers who grouse and whine about the hardships of the wild, rangers respond with some mixture of amusement, frustration, and compassion. But they quickly learn that other adventurers who can carry their own weight in a fight are worth any extra burden. Coddled city folk might not know how to feed themselves or find fresh water in the wild, but they make up for it in other ways.</p>
    <h4>CREATING A RANGER</h4>
    <p>As you create your ranger character, consider the nature of the training that gave you your particular capabilities. Did you train with a single mentor, wandering the wilds together until you mastered the ranger’s ways? Did you leave your apprenticeship, or was your mentor slain— perhaps by the same kind of monster that became your favored enemy? Or perhaps you learned your skills as part of a band of rangers affiliated with a druidic circle, trained in mystic paths as well as wilderness lore. You might be self-taught, a recluse who learned combat skills, tracking, and natural remedies through the necessity of surviving in the wilds.</p>
    <p class="indent">What’s the source of your particular expertise in a certain kind of enemy? Did a monster kill someone you loved or destroy your home village? Or did you see too many innocent creatures destroyed by these monsters and commit yourself to reining in their depredations? Is your adventuring career a continuation of your work in protecting the borderlands, or a significant change?</p>
    <p class="indent">What made you join up with a band of adventurers? Do you find it challenging to teach new allies the ways of the wild, or do you welcome the relief from solitude that they offer?</p>
    <h5 class="caption">QUICK BUILD</h5>
    <p>You can make a ranger quickly by following these suggestions. First, make Dexterity your highest ability score, followed by Wisdom. (Some rangers who focus on athletics and heavy weapons make Strength higher than Dexterity.) Second, choose the outlander background.</p>
