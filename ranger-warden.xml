        <description>
            <p>When you reach 3rd level, you augment your martial prowess with the ability to cast spells.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Cantrips.</em></strong> You learn three cantrips: shillelagh and two other cantrips of your choice from the druid spell list. You learn another druid cantrip of your choice at 10th level. These cantrips become warden spells for you.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Spell Slots.</em></strong> The Warden Spellcasting table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>
            <p class="indent">For example, if you know the 1st-level spell ensnaring strike and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast ensnaring strike using either slot.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher.</em></strong> You know three 1st-level spells of your choice from the druid or ranger spell list, two of which must be from the transmutation or conjuration schools. These spells become warden spells for you.</p>
            <p class="indent">The Spells Known column of the Warden Spellcasting table shows when you learn more druid or ranger spells of 1st level or higher. Each of these spells must be a transmutation or conjuration spell of your choice, and must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 7th level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.</p>
            <p class="indent">The spells you learn at 8th, 14th, and 20th level can come from any school of magic.</p>
            <p class="indent">Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of the spells you know with another spell of your choice from the druid or ranger spell list. The new spell must be of a level for which you have spell slots, and it must be a transmutation or conjuration spell, unless you're replacing the spell you gained at 3rd, 8th, 14th, or 20th level from any school of magic.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Spellcasting Ability.</em></strong> Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your warden spells, since they are derived from your instinctive connection to primal magic. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a warden spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>
            <center>
                <p><strong>Spell save DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p>
                <p><strong>Spell attack modifier</strong> = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p>
            </center>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Spellcasting Focus.</em></strong> You can use a druidic focus as a spellcasting focus for your warden spells.</p>
