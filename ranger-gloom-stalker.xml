            <p>Gloom stalkers are at home in the darkest places: deep under the earth, in gloomy alleyways, in primeval forests, and wherever else the light dims. Most folk enter such places with trepidation, but a gloom stalker ventures boldly into the darkness, seeking to ambush threats before they can reach the broader world. Such rangers are often found in the Underdark, but they will go any place where evil lurks in the shadows.</p>

            <p>At 3rd level, you master the art of the ambush. At the start of your first turn of each combat, your walking speed increases by 10 feet, which lasts until the end of that turn. If you take the Attack action on that turn, you can make one additional weapon attack as part of that action. If that attack hits, the target takes an extra 1d8 damage of the weapon's damage type.</p>

            <p>At 3rd level, your eyes have become accustomed to heavy darkness. You gain darkvision out to a range of 60 feet. If you already have darkvision, its range increases by 30 feet.</p>
            <p class="indent">You are also adept at evading creatures that rely on darkvision. While in dim light or darkness, you have advantage on Stealth checks to hide from any creature that relies on darkvision to see you.</p>

            <p>Your senses are finely attuned to detect nearby foes even when blinded or in magical darkness. At 7th level, you gain blindsight with a range of 10 feet, or an additional 10 feet if you already have blindsight.</p>
            <p class="indent">In addition, you can stand still, focus, and extend your senses further, picking up on the subtlest vibrations, even through walls. As an action, you can grant yourself tremorsense within a 30 foot radius. Moving or taking damage causes you to lose this sense. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and regain all uses upon completing a long rest.</p>

            <p>At 11th level, you learn to attack with such unexpected speed that you can turn a miss into another strike. Once on each of your turns when you miss with a weapon attack, you can make another weapon attack as part of the same action.</p>

            <p>Starting at 15th level, you can dodge in unforeseen ways, making expert use of the shadows around you. Whenever a creature makes an attack roll against you and doesn't have advantage on the roll, you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on it. You must use this feature before you know the outcome of the attack roll.</p>
